### Hi there, I'm a Backend Java Developer ðŸ‘‹

## About Me

I'm a passionate backend developer with experience in JavaScript, Python and Web Development(HTML, CSS, JS, React and Node.JS), and im learning Micro FrontEnd. I'm also skilled in developing games using RenPy and making great coffee as a barista.

## Hobbies

In my free time, I love to watch anime (Monogatari Series is PEAK) and my favorite series are Breaking Bad, Better Call Saul, Arcane and The Sopranos. I also enjoy reading manga and I'm currently working on becoming a mangaka myself.

## Current Project

My current project is Yume No Office (Now in Steam), a game developed using RenPy. It's a visual novel that tells the story of a group of office workers and their daily struggles.

## Learning

I'm currently teaching myself how to use React, and MERN Stack, in Front End development.

Thanks for checking out my profile! Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or just want to chat.
